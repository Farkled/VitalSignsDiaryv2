# VitalSignsDiaryv2
 Vital Signs Diary, Statistics and plots for analysis.  Now, completely menu-driven with help.  Plots Glucaose, Blood Pressures and Heart Rate over time. New program added that plots nDay Moving Averages for any or all of the 6 vital signs tracked in the app.  This last program is a very useful analytical tool.
 Uses Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and TKinter so it pretty plain vanilla. Runtime to process about 7 years of data (12700 Excel rows) has been on the order of 10 seocnds.
 
 Written by a self-taught Pythin novice with a background in Fortran and various dialects  of basic means that there is much room to make the code more object oriented.  There is also room for performance enhancement since I go for clarity over brevity in code.  I've done enough testing to meet my needs,but few programs survive first contact with the real world.
